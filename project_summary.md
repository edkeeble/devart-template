Missed Connections

## Description
You are who you know or, at least, who we think you know. Missed Connections is a piece about shared spaces and shared networks. It allows participants to enter a physical space and, without any active engagement on their part, see who they may be connected to through common wireless networks. It provides them a glimpse of how they may appear to advertisers and others for whom social associations are a relevant data point.

The piece analyses the wireless packets broadcast by most smartphones to detect known WiFi networks to associate those networks with individual participants. It then continuously probes the smartphones to determine their location within the installation space and visualize the connections between participants.
